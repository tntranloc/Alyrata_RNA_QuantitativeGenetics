### Collected scripts for my PhD project in Quantitative Genetics in plant transcriptome and fitness. 

- AnimalModel_collected_scripts.Rmd shows methods to run Animal Model over the past decade, starting with pedigreemm and ending with current brms package
- plantCV_computervision_...md is a Python workflow to analyse plant images in a higher throughput manner
- plot_quantGene_concept_model.md shows how to visualise allele substitution effect and genetic variance components in different scenarios of dominance, additive, underdominance, overdominance, etc
- genetic_variance_analysis_brms.R is an Rscript to run Animal Model on large scale data such as gene count matrix on cluster
  
- eQTL_analysis_with_qtltools.sh shows how to perform expression QTL analysis with qtltools
